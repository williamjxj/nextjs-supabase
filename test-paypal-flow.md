# PayPal Flow Testing Guide

## Current Issues Fixed

1. **Gallery URL Parameter Handling**: Added proper handling for PayPal callback parameters in the gallery component
2. **Middleware Authentication**: Modified middleware to allow PayPal callback URLs to pass through even without authentication
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in PayPal checkout and capture flows
4. **User Feedback**: Added toast notifications for PayPal status updates in the gallery

## Test Steps

### 1. Test PayPal Cancellation Flow
1. Navigate to `/gallery` (make sure you're logged in)
2. Click on an image and select "Purchase"
3. Choose PayPal as payment method
4. In the PayPal popup, click "Cancel"
5. **Expected**: Should redirect back to `/gallery?paypal_cancelled=true`
6. **Expected**: Gallery should show a warning toast: "PayPal payment was cancelled. You can try again anytime."
7. **Expected**: URL should be cleaned up (no more `paypal_cancelled=true` parameter)

### 2. Test PayPal Success Flow
1. Navigate to `/gallery` (make sure you're logged in)
2. Click on an image and select "Purchase"
3. Choose PayPal as payment method
4. Complete the PayPal payment successfully
5. **Expected**: Should redirect to `/purchase/success?paymentId=xxx&method=paypal&imageId=xxx&licenseType=xxx`
6. **Expected**: Purchase success page should load and show purchase details

### 3. Test PayPal Error Flow
1. Navigate to `/gallery` (make sure you're logged in)
2. Click on an image and select "Purchase"
3. Choose PayPal as payment method
4. If PayPal API returns an error during order creation:
   - **Expected**: Should show error alert
   - **Expected**: Should redirect to `/gallery?paypal_error=error_message`
   - **Expected**: Gallery should show error toast with the error message

### 4. Test Authentication Bypass for PayPal Callbacks
1. Log out of the application
2. Manually navigate to `/gallery?paypal_cancelled=true`
3. **Expected**: Should be able to access the gallery page (bypassing authentication)
4. **Expected**: Should see the PayPal cancellation toast message
5. **Expected**: After seeing the message, subsequent visits to `/gallery` should require authentication
