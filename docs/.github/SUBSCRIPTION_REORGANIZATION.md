# Subscription System Reorganization

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Account Page Subscription Display**

- **Before**: Showed "Unknown Plan" and "$NaN/" due to incorrect data structure expectations
- **After**: Properly displays subscription plan name, price, and billing information using our subscription data structure

### 2. **Subscription Page Logic**

- **Before**: When already subscribed, users didn't see their current subscription details
- **After**: Shows comprehensive subscription management with current plan details

### 3. **Confusing URL Structure**

- **Before**: Messy routing with `/pricing`, `/membership`, `/account`, `/account/subscriptions` (plural)
- **After**: Clean, logical structure with proper hierarchy

## üóÇÔ∏è **New Page Structure**

### **Public Pages**

- **`/pricing`** - Public pricing page for all users (logged in or not)
  - Clean pricing cards with monthly/yearly toggle
  - Payment method selection (Stripe, PayPal, Crypto)
  - Redirects to login if user not authenticated

### **Account Pages**

- **`/account`** - Main account dashboard

  - Profile overview with email and member since date
  - Subscription status card with plan details
  - Quick action links to other account pages
  - Clean sidebar with navigation

- **`/account/subscription`** - Subscription management (singular)

  - Detailed subscription information
  - Payment method and billing details
  - Plan features list
  - Billing portal access for Stripe users

  - Edit full name and view account info
  - Avatar upload placeholder
  - Account security information

- **`/account/settings`** - Account settings
  - Notification preferences
  - Security settings (password, 2FA)
  - Danger zone with account deletion

### **Legacy Redirects**

- **`/membership`** - Redirects to `/pricing` for better organization

## üîÑ **User Flow**
