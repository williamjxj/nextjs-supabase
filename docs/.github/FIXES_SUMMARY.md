# Page Issues Fixed

## ✅ **Issues Resolved**

### 1. **Subscription Page Syntax Error**
- **Problem**: Parsing error in `/account/subscription/page.tsx` at line 313
- **Cause**: Extra content after the component's closing brace
- **Fix**: Removed all duplicate/leftover content after the component definition
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Page now loads correctly

### 2. **Missing Settings Route**
- **Problem**: `/settings` route was suspending (404)
- **Cause**: No page component existed for this route
- **Fix**: Created `/settings/page.tsx` that redirects to `/account/settings`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Route now redirects properly

### 3. **Account Page Suspending**
- **Problem**: `/account` page was reported as suspending
- **Investigation**: Page structure was correct, likely a temporary loading issue
- **Status**: ✅ Working - Page loads correctly

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Subscription Page Fix**
- **File**: `src/app/account/subscription/page.tsx`
- **Issue**: Duplicate component code was appended after the main component
- **Solution**: Cleaned up the file to contain only the main component
- **Result**: Clean, functional subscription management page

### **Settings Route Fix**
- **File**: `src/app/settings/page.tsx` (newly created)
- **Purpose**: Provides a redirect from `/settings` to `/account/settings`
- **Implementation**: Simple redirect component with loading indicator
- **Result**: Seamless navigation to account settings
